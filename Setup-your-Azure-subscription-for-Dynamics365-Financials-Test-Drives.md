    *	Type below commands in AzureAD Powershell to make app company administrator
        *	" Connect-MsolService "  (login screen comes up with this command and use administrator credentials of tenant)

        *	" Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName 'Company Administrator' -RoleMemberType ServicePrincipal -RoleMemberObjectId ‘ObjectId’ " (Replace ‘ObjectId’ with ObjectId copied in above step)
